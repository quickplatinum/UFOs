# UFO Wesbite Visualization Challenge
Module 11: UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Resources and Software’s Utilized

1. Visual Studio Code
2. JavaScript ES6

## Purpose and Overview 

- Background: Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

The deliverables for the assignment are as follows:

- Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis

## Results and Analysis

- The original website included the ability to filter and search only via the date. After some work editing the original JavaScript and HTML code, we were able to implement further searches as well as change the format and design of the website to make it easier to use and more appealing to users of the space genre. Making it polished grey and adding a NASA image header. I also added some finishing personal touches.

- Anyone can use the website when clicking in there is a short description about the data within the website, and the filters are clearly visible and each criterion can be filtered, the user can see the filter search heading. and the data broken up into the fields on the right.

- Seen below in the image attached is the updated website, adding a few filters to better assist users find specific data, the new filter includes Date, City, State and Country to name a few.

- For example, we can check that the filters are working, a search below for the data on January 6th, 2010, in the state of California. We can also see that the code is working upon the user input of enter instead of clicking which was intended.

## Summary

### Potential Drawbacks of website design:

1. The biggest drawback of the website design is not knowing what options to choose from in the various filters, so if a specific country or state is not available for selection the result does not get output. So not knowing what variables are included in the parameters is frustrating when searching for data. 
2. Another one of the drawback of the website that I noticed while using it to sift through the data is the filters only accept exact values, for examples when looking for the state of California, I typed CA instead of ca. A good idea would be to allow some errors in the filter so that results are easier to find, so instead of equal matches, similar matches can be updated in the code

### Additional Recommendations:

1. A recommendation would be to include a drop-down menu on the filters so that users can see what parameters and variables each option has, for example a list of the countries. This way the user knows there is no data for "Indiana" as an example and would not waste time searching it.
2. Perhaps at the top or bottom of the table. Clearing the filters using a button to clear the filters is also a great idea.
